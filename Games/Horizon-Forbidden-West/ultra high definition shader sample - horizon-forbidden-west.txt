- DISCLAIMER - 

This sample is for demonstrating graphics research and development work I have conducted.

Unless specified, I have not worked on any of the game titles nor am i employed by or associated with the respective game development companies.

Video content is used under FAIR USE.

The real-time post effects I researched and developed can be used in games and film.

I am in the middle of porting it to game engines, like Unity and Unreal Engine.

It is currently working under Reshade, a shader injector tool.



- ABOUT ENHANCED GRAPHICS SAMPLE - 

In this sample, I tried enhancing the quality of the video image of Horizon Forbidden West - Burning Shores by Guerrilla Games.

Due to differences in production, different games and films will yield different results, sometimes subtle and sometimes more pronounced.

I think that the shader graphics enhancement results on Horizon Forbidden West were good, subtly increasing graphics clarity and sharpness, surface details, illumination, shadow and color.

The details on character clothing, equipment, and machines becomes clearer and sharper, and lighting and illumination becomes enhanced with LUMA, my post process virtual illumination tech. 

However some quality is degraded due to the video capture process. 

Looking at it live in real-time gives a much better impression.  



- SHADER ENHANCEMENTS -

The shader effect enhances the following:

* light - makes light sources in games and film look closer to real world emissive physical light

* shadow - enhances self contrasting shadows

* image detail - enhances fine image details, making the image sharper, clearer with better fidelity.

* color - tone-mapping, small amounts of HDR coloring and color vibrancy shaders enhance the color richness


- SCREENSHOTS & VIDEOS-

When there is enough online cloud storage available, screenshots and/or video will be made available.


- VIDEO COMPARISON TOOL -

To use the video comparison tool (NVidia ICAT), open the index.html file in any browser.

The video comparison tool has 2 modes, side by side and split screen.

There are various UI controls at the bottom for making the videos fit to your screen, zooming in and going full screen mode.

There is also a UI for changing the image filtering from nearest neighbor to bilinear filtering.
