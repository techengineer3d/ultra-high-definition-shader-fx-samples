This is a video capture of one of my ultra high definition post effects applied to a clip of the CD Projekt Witcher 4 UE5 tech demo. 

It is an example of how a next generation, ultra high definition game could potentially look with my graphics enhancement technology.

It features LUMA,  my "Virtual Illumination For Digital Images" tech, plus ultra fine detail enhancements, local contrast shadows, and color enhancers.

In this sample, the lighting effect has been made a little brighter, in order to see the effects clearly. 

(I do have versions of my shader effects that closely maintain parity with the original media's lighting, exposure, contrast and brightness levels).

Although my post effects were applied to a video clip of the game/demo, my post effects are real-time an can be run on 3d games as well.

If the post effects were run on the game in realtime, the results would look very similar to what is seen in the provided video clip (marked "enhanced").


What to look for lighting and detail enhancements in the following areas:


* Outdoor lighting, highlights, glint, light emission, radiance, glow, exposure effects

* Self Contrast Shadowing

* Fabric and clothing color, details, patterns, embroidery, stitching

* Character skin tone, facial features, facial hair, hair fidelity and specular shine, eye color and specular shine

* Animal skin detail and specular shine

* Animal fur fidelity and specular shine 

* Metal material shine and light reflection

* Surface details and highlights - ground, flooring, panels, patterns

* Natural Environments - sharper detailed trees and plant vegetation

* Natural Elements - enhanced appearance of fire and water surfaces
