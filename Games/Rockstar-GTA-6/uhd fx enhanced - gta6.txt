In this sample, I tried enhancing the trailer for the game grand theft auto 6 by rockstar games.

The real-time post effects I researched and developed can be used in games, or also film and video.

I am in the middle of trying to port it to game engines, like Unity and Unreal Engine.

It is currently working under Reshade, a shader injector tool.


The shader effect enhances the following:

* light - makes light look closer to real world emissive physical light

* shadow - enhances self contrast shadows

* image detail - enhances fine image details, making the image sharper, clearer with better fidelity.

* color - tonemapping and color vibrancy enhance the color richness
