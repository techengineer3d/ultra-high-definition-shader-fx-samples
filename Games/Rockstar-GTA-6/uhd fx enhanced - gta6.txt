- ABOUT ENHANCED GTA 6 SAMPLE - 

In this sample, I tried enhancing the trailer for the game grand theft auto 6 by rockstar games.

The real-time post effects I researched and developed can be used in games, or also film and video.

I am in the middle of trying to port it to game engines, like Unity and Unreal Engine.

It is currently working under Reshade, a shader injector tool.


- SHADER ENHANCEMENTS -

The shader effect enhances the following:

* light - makes light look closer to real world emissive physical light

* shadow - enhances self contrast shadows

* image detail - enhances fine image details, making the image sharper, clearer with better fidelity.

* color - tonemapping and color vibrancy enhance the color richness


- VIDEO COMPARISON TOOL -

To use the video comparison tool (NVidia ICAT), open the index.html file in any browser.

The video comparison tool has 2 modes, side by side and split screen.

There are various UI controls at the bottom for making the videos fit to your screen, zooming in and going full screen mode.

There is also a UI for changing the image filtering from nearest neighbor to bilinear filtering.
